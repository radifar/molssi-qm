This repo is based on [MOLSSI Quantum Mechanics Tools](https://education.molssi.org/qm-tools/) workshop which uses Psi4. I integrate the RDKit so that it can be solely written/practiced within Jupyter Notebook instead of relying on external GUI-based molecular visualization tools (e.g. Avogadro, PyMOL, VMD, ChimeraX).

Prerequirement:  
Conda/Anaconda

To setup run the following command:  
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate qmmm
```

Then open Jupyter Notebook:  
```
jupyter notebook
```
